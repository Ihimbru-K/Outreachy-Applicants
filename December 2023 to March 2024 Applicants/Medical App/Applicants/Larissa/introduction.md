Hello,<br><br>
My name is **Larissa**, and I am from Madagascar. I am software developer who is proficient with Ruby, JavaScript, and familiar with Java.
I have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.<br> Unfortunately, after my graduation I couldn't find jobs within the tech industry in my country. So I decided to create my own small beekeeping business. <br>
I run it successfully for three years. Though I loved doing what I did, I still wanted to join the tech industry. So, on November 2022, I decided to join an online bootcamp to refresh my skills.
I recently finished and decided to apply for internships to acquire real world experience. <br>
I've always been fascinated by how technology shapes our lives, and what MboaLab does is truly inspiring. They're making positive changes in our community through science and technology.
This kind of initiative is still quite rare in Africa, where technology is still in its early stages. That's one of the main reasons I want to be a part of this project. 
I want to bring meaningful change through my skills.  <br>
Apart from my love for tech that can help others, I'm also a huge fan of cats, I mean, I am the crazy cat lady herself ðŸ˜¸.
I'm incredibly curious about many things, which is why I used to enjoy watching "How It's Made" on TV (though I don't watch TV much these days).
I'm also an avid reader, especially when it comes to books on personal development and business.  My (all-time) favorite is "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck" by Mark Manson. <br>
That is all for now. I am looking forward to work alongside you. <br>
