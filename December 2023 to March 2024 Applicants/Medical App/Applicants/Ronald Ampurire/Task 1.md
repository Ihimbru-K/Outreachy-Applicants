## Getting Familiar with the Project

Since I already had a GitHub account and all the other tools set up,  I started by forking the "December 2023 to March 2024 Applicants" repository

### Steps Taken:

### 1. Forked the 'December 2023 to March 2024 Applicants' repository
After forking, I cloned it to my machine

### 2. Downloaded the Medical App Source Code
I obtained the app's source code from its GitHub repository.
