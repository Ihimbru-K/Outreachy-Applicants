### 2. Problem statement



#### * Lack of Connectivity and Collaboration: 

The healthcare industry faces challenges in connecting and collaborating across various medical facilities globally, resulting in inefficiencies and suboptimal patient care. There is a lack of an effective platform that enables seamless collaboration among healthcare professionals and institutions.

### * Fragmented Communication and Missed Opportunities: 
The current disjointed approach to global medical facility connectivity leads to fragmented communication, delays in accessing critical information, and missed opportunities for collaboration. This hinders the ability of healthcare providers to share knowledge, expertise, and resources, ultimately impacting patient outcomes.

#### Need for Improved Healthcare Outcomes
The absence of a reliable platform for global medical facility connectivity prevents healthcare professionals from efficiently sharing patient data, consulting peers, and coordinating care plans across borders. To address this, there is a need for a solution like the Mboacare app, which aims to connect medical facilities worldwide and facilitate effortless collaboration. By leveraging technology, Mboacare strives to improve healthcare outcomes by enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, access specialized consultations, share best practices, and collectively work towards advancing medical research and innovation.
