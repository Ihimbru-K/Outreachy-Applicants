## Project
The Mboacare Application is an open-source application designed to address a critical problem in healthcare - the lack of easily accessible information about hospital services and locations. This documentation outlines our project's objectives, problem statement, methodology, current features and proposed modifications or updates.

## Problem statement 
In today's age, one of the major challenges in healthcare is the limited availability of information about hospitals' services and their locations. This leads to difficulties for both healthcare professionals and patients in finding the right hospital for specific medical needs. As a result of this information gap, delays occur in finding treatment which lead to increased costs,and even higher mortality rates.

## Objective
Mboacare aims to connect hospitals and healthcare facilities to share information and resources effectively. The primary objectives are as follows:
+ Develop an open-source application for hospitals to register their services and facilities
+ Create a user-friendly interface for both hospitals and patients
+ Enable patients to search for hospitals based on their medical needs and location
+ Enable hospitals and to search for other hospitals to make referals based on medical needs and location
+ Improve patient care by reducing delays in finding suitable healthcare facilities
+ The Ultimate goal is to reduce mortality rates by facilitating quicker access to appropriate medical care
