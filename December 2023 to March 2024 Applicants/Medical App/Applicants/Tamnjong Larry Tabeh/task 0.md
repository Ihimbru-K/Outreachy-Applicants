My name is **Tamnjong Larry Tabeh** I am 23 years old and I live in Bamenda, Cameroon. I am an aspiring and upcoming software developer
with some skills in **FLutter, Dart, PHP, Javascript, git and some core Java**. I am originally an accountant but I loved programming so while in school i spent most of my free time taking udemy courses and teaching myself to code.

I love listening  to music mostly American hip hop gospel music and I don't really do sports but when I do, I play table tennis. 
At home if I am not coding or listening to music then I'm helping my 2 kid brothers with their assignments and if I'm not doing any of those then most definitely I with my father at his farm.

I am really Excited about this opportunity and I just want to learn, contribute and support the community.
